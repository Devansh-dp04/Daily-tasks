# Daily-tasks

## Day1 
Created a basic calculator app having (+ , - , * , / , %) mathematical operations using while loop and switch cases.

## Day2
Created a file to compresses a string by replacing consecutive duplicate characters with their count. 

## Day3
Create a C# program to simulate a bank account system where various actions (like depositing money, withdrawing money) trigger events. The program will use events and event handlers to respond to these actions, and multiple event handlers will take different actions when the events are raised. 

## Day4
Write a program that starts multiple asynchronous tasks and uses Task.WhenAny() to continue execution when the first task completes. Print the result of the first task that finishes.

## OOPS-Day1
### 1. Class Design & Encapsulation
  Create a Student class with attributes:
  
  ID (int)
  
  Name (string)
  
  Age (int)
  
  Grade (string)
  
  Marks (private int)
  
  Use Encapsulation:
  
Restrict direct access to the Marks attribute. Provide getter and setter methods (SetMarks() and GetMarks()) for controlled modification. Validate that marks cannot be negative or above 100.
  
  Implement:
  
  Parameterized Constructor for initialization. Destructor to display a cleanup message when an object is destroyed.

### Tasks to Implement:
Create Students & Manage Their Records:

Add at least 5 students using the constructor.

Validate marks using encapsulation rules.
